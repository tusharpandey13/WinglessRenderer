# WinglessRenderer
A custom 2d graphics renderer based on OpenGL


This is an OpenTK wrapper for winforms(or any .net application) which provides easy and efficient 2d drawing functions as compared to the
original GDI+.

How to use:
(When updated,) Drop the .dll in your bin dir and add a reference to it.


Still in dev, will update once .dll is made.
